# Gradient Blur (Aurora) & Frosted Glassmorphism (Motion Graphics Standard)
*Ported from award-winning aetheria-motion motion system.*

# Gradient Blur (Aurora) & Glassmorphism Motion Design

**Reference Benchmark**: Aurora: Think In Light · 1920×1080 · 30 fps · 10 s · AI Jury Score 8.07 / 10

**Reference Source**: [cues.json](../../../references/aetheria-motion/demos/12-aurora-glass/cues.json) · [index.html](../../../references/aetheria-motion/demos/12-aurora-glass/index.html)

## How to Use

1. Open Aetheria Video Studio and invoke this skill using the command or natural language.
2. The skill injects the creative seed, timing choreography, palette tokens, and motion curves into the LLM context.
3. **Customization**: Adapt the narrative, brand names, copy, and palette in `Creative seed` while preserving `Signature features` to retain the iconic visual identity of this archetype.
4. **Verification**: Review the resulting Aetheria HTML film (workspace/index.html) in the interactive Studio player against the motion design craft checklist below to guarantee award-winning quality.

# Vertical 9:16 Spatial Layout Contract (1080×1920 Mobile Standard)
When generating vertical 9:16 content, LLM MUST strictly adhere to this vertical spatial zoning to avoid empty voids, clashing elements, or UI clipping:

| Zone ID | Vertical Span (Y) | Component Type | Constraints & Styling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zone 0** | `Y: 60 – 240px` | Top Header Bar & Stamp/Badge | Monospace topic bar across top (`Y: 70`). Stamps/tags MUST be anchored to top-left (`left: 64`) or top-right (`right: 64`) with 8–14° tilt. **NEVER slap large text in center X:50% that occludes the hero below!** |
| **Zone 1** | `Y: 260 – 920px` | Backdrop Graphic Bed / Sheet | Angled style-specific backdrop, grid card, or paper scrap (`width: 720–820px`, tilted -8° to +8°). Serves as visual backing so the hero never floats in an empty void. |
| **Zone 2** | `Y: 340 – 1050px` | Hero Subject / Core Visual Anchor | Primary focal point. `width: 520–620px`, `height: 600–720px`, centered. Wajib style-specific rim/border/glow and subtle micro-motion/jitter. |
| **Zone 3** | `Y: 880 – 1100px` | Style Accents & Connectors | Style-specific accent props (pointing hands, stickers, sparks, geometric chips) bridging transition between hero and headline. |
| **Zone 4** | `Y: 1100 – 1380px` | Bold Style Action Headline | High-contrast headline card/plaque with `box-shadow: 8px 8px 0 #1A1A1A`, uppercase bold typography (`fontSize: 64–76px`), and sub-badge (`fontSize: 20–24px`). |
| **Zone 5** | `Y: 1500 – 1720px` | Kinetic Subtitles (Hormozi) | Clean word chips anchored at `bottom: 200–240px`. Maximum font size 58–64px with lemon-yellow `#FFDE59` active pop. |
| **Deadzone**| `Y > 1750px` & `X > 960px` | TikTok UI Exclusion Zone | NEVER place critical text or heroes in the bottom 180px or extreme right rail (avatar, like, comment, share, sound disc). |

# Aetheria Modular HTML Motion Engine Contract (Mandatory)
Never cram a multi-scene video into a single 1,000-line HTML file. Split scenes into modular scripts (no React, no TypeScript):
1. Write each scene in `workspace/script/scene1.js` .. `workspace/script/sceneN.js` (~120–180 lines each) using `AM.registerScene("scene1_id", function(ctx, localTime, dur, scene, AM) { ... })`.
2. Include `<script src="/script/aetheria-motion.js"></script>` and `<script src="/script/scene1.js"></script>` .. `<script src="/script/sceneN.js"></script>` in `workspace/index.html` `<head>`.
3. Define `SCENES` and `window.__filmMeta = { title, width: 1080, height: 1920, fps: 30, duration, durationInFrames, scenes: SCENES }`.
4. Define `window.renderAt = function(t) { ... }` where `t` is time in seconds, dispatching `AM.getSceneRenderer(scene.id, resolved.index)` plus `AM.drawTopHeader`, `AM.drawHeadlinePlaque`, and `AM.drawSubtitles`.
5. Call `window.renderAt(0); window.__ready = true;` once initialized.

# Suggested technical route
HTML WebGL: aurora mesh-gradient shader + glass refraction (SDF lens, chromatic dispersion) + DOM/CSS backdrop-filter glass cards
(You may choose a better route if it clearly raises quality; say why.)

# Creative seed
"Liquid Glass"2025–26 AI-product-launch aesthetic: slow, translucent, expensive.
- Deep indigo-black base; 4–5 aurora blobs (violet/blue/cyan/magenta, adjacent hues only) drifting on bezier paths, blending into a mesh gradient, 3–5% noise dithering (no banding).
- Frosted glass cards (backdrop blur ~30px, 5–10% white fill, 1px 30% white inner highlight, large radius) float in with parallax depth and slight 3D tilt; micro-UI inside (chat bubble, voice waveform, toggles) animates with opacity + 8px rise.
- WOW: a Liquid-Glass lens (true refraction, chromatic dispersion on the rim, specular edge) glides across and magnifies the aurora and the cards.
- Title (invented product, e.g. "Aurora — think in light") in a light elegant sans; sine/breathing easing everywhere; nothing fast.
Sound: ambient cinematic pad, soft shimmer, very subtle UI ticks.

You are the director: you may change the concept, copy, story beats and brand names if you find a stronger idea, but the result must remain the CANONICAL, instantly-recognisable form of this style and must hit its signature features below.

# Signature features and key techniques (the result is judged against these)
A sleek, modern aesthetic widely adopted by luxury tech and AI interfaces. Features multi-stop mesh gradients drifting smoothly behind frosted, blurred glass containers with razor-thin specular borders.

**Visual Features**: Large shifting radial gradient spots, Gaussian blur (40–120px), backdrop-filter blur(16–32px), translucent milky glass cards, iridescent specular edges, ambient breathing rhythm.

**Key Techniques**:
- Mesh gradient drift: 3 to 5 color blobs orbiting with sinusoidal phase offsets (`Math.sin(frame * 0.02)`).
- Glass material: `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`, `backdrop-filter: blur(24px)`, `border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.2)`.
- Lighting & Refraction: Chromatic aberration accents on borders and glowing highlights.
- Transitions: Fluid light sweeps, soft luminance crossfades, and expanding glass panels.

# How to work
1. Treatment. Write down one clear idea: a hook in the first 0.5 s (never open on more than 0.3 s of empty or black), an
   escalation, one unmistakable hero moment at ~60–75 % of the runtime, and a composed end frame held ~0.8–1.2 s with living
   micro-motion. Map every signature feature above to a moment. Keep one cue sheet (beats and hit times) that both the
   picture and the sound read from.
2. Key frames before motion. Build the look, render stills at 6–10 key times and actually look at them. Each still should be
   poster-worthy: composition, hierarchy, negative space, type set properly (kerning, line-height, weight contrast, ~5 % safe margins). Iterate until nothing looks default, generic, cramped or "AI-template".
3. Motion. Build the choreography and preview at low resolution. Step through the fastest moves frame by frame: spacing,
   easing, arcs, overlap, anticipation and follow-through, motion blur. No unintended dead spans; the energy follows the music.
4. Sound. Write genre-correct music and sound design locked to the cue sheet. Check that visual hits land on audio onsets.
   Master to the output spec.
5. Final. Render at full resolution (motion blur where apt), then check: exactly 10.00 s, resolution, fps, audio present and at
   the right loudness, no black frames, no fallback fonts or tofu, no clipped elements at the frame edges, no shimmer on thin
   lines, no gradient banding. Fix and repeat until you would submit it to a festival.
6. Write an honest self-critique: what is strongest, what is weakest, what you would do with more time.

# Rules
- Rendering must be deterministic: every frame is a pure function of time t. Seeded randomness only; physics and particles
  precomputed or closed-form; no real-time clocks; no state-triggered CSS transitions. A reliable route: a web page that can
  draw any time t on request, captured frame by frame with a headless browser and encoded with ffmpeg (or a Blender script
  that renders a PNG sequence).
- Assets: only CC0 / public domain / OFL / Apache / free-for-commercial-use. Record each source and licence in CREDITS.md.
  No real brand trademarks; invent brand names.
- On-screen text must be correct, punchy, and natural: proper typography, zero overflow, no typos.

# Craft checklist (what a jury looks for)
- Style authenticity: an expert names the style in one second; every signature technique is present and executed correctly.
- Motion craft: purposeful easing (no linear unless mechanical by design), overlap and stagger, anticipation and
  follow-through, arcs, squash and stretch where the style allows, consistent physics, motion blur where apt; transitions
  carried by elements, not crossfades.
- Rhythm: hits locked to the music; contrast between busy and calm; no monotony.
- Design: strong composition, grid, typographic hierarchy, controlled palette; texture and finishing (grain, glow, vignette)
  only where the style wants it; nothing looks accidental.
- Technical polish: no jitter (unless intended), no popping, no aliasing, no banding, no fallback fonts, no half-loaded images.
- Sound: genre-correct, musical, synced, mastered.

# Before you deliver, score yourself honestly
1–10 on style fidelity, concept wow, motion craft, design & typography, finish & texture, sound & sync, technical
(6 = template-level, 8 = high-end agency, 9 = award shortlist). Aim for 9; fix whatever scores lowest first.

# Deliver
video.mp4, plus a short report: the concept in two sentences; a beat sheet with timecodes; how each signature feature is
realised; the tech route; check numbers (duration, resolution, fps, loudness, true peak); your honest top-3 weaknesses.
