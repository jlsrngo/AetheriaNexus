# Isometric 2.5D / Technical Axonometric (Motion Graphics Standard)
*Ported from award-winning aetheria-motion motion system.*

# Isometric 2.5D & Axonometric Technical Motion Design

**Reference Benchmark**: ISOPOLISLet the City Grow Itself · 1920×1080 · 30 fps · 10 s · AI Jury Score 8.00 / 10

**Reference Source**: [cues.json](../../../references/aetheria-motion/demos/03-isometric/cues.json) · [index.html](../../../references/aetheria-motion/demos/03-isometric/index.html)

## How to Use

1. Open Aetheria Video Studio and invoke this skill using the command or natural language.
2. The skill injects the creative seed, timing choreography, palette tokens, and motion curves into the LLM context.
3. **Customization**: Adapt the narrative, brand names, copy, and palette in `Creative seed` while preserving `Signature features` to retain the iconic visual identity of this archetype.
4. **Verification**: Review the resulting Aetheria HTML film (workspace/index.html) in the interactive Studio player against the motion design craft checklist below to guarantee award-winning quality.

# Vertical 9:16 Spatial Layout Contract (1080×1920 Mobile Standard)
When generating vertical 9:16 content, LLM MUST strictly adhere to this vertical spatial zoning to avoid empty voids, clashing elements, or UI clipping:

| Zone ID | Vertical Span (Y) | Component Type | Constraints & Styling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zone 0** | `Y: 60 – 240px` | Top Header Bar & Stamp/Badge | Monospace topic bar across top (`Y: 70`). Stamps/tags MUST be anchored to top-left (`left: 64`) or top-right (`right: 64`) with 8–14° tilt. **NEVER slap large text in center X:50% that occludes the hero below!** |
| **Zone 1** | `Y: 260 – 920px` | Backdrop Graphic Bed / Sheet | Angled style-specific backdrop, grid card, or paper scrap (`width: 720–820px`, tilted -8° to +8°). Serves as visual backing so the hero never floats in an empty void. |
| **Zone 2** | `Y: 340 – 1050px` | Hero Subject / Core Visual Anchor | Primary focal point. `width: 520–620px`, `height: 600–720px`, centered. Wajib style-specific rim/border/glow and subtle micro-motion/jitter. |
| **Zone 3** | `Y: 880 – 1100px` | Style Accents & Connectors | Style-specific accent props (pointing hands, stickers, sparks, geometric chips) bridging transition between hero and headline. |
| **Zone 4** | `Y: 1100 – 1380px` | Bold Style Action Headline | High-contrast headline card/plaque with `box-shadow: 8px 8px 0 #1A1A1A`, uppercase bold typography (`fontSize: 64–76px`), and sub-badge (`fontSize: 20–24px`). |
| **Zone 5** | `Y: 1500 – 1720px` | Kinetic Subtitles (Hormozi) | Clean word chips anchored at `bottom: 200–240px`. Maximum font size 58–64px with lemon-yellow `#FFDE59` active pop. |
| **Deadzone**| `Y > 1750px` & `X > 960px` | TikTok UI Exclusion Zone | NEVER place critical text or heroes in the bottom 180px or extreme right rail (avatar, like, comment, share, sound disc). |

# Aetheria Modular HTML Motion Engine Contract (Mandatory)
Never cram a multi-scene video into a single 1,000-line HTML file. Split scenes into modular scripts (no React, no TypeScript):
1. Write each scene in `workspace/script/scene1.js` .. `workspace/script/sceneN.js` (~120–180 lines each) using `AM.registerScene("scene1_id", function(ctx, localTime, dur, scene, AM) { ... })`.
2. Include `<script src="/script/aetheria-motion.js"></script>` and `<script src="/script/scene1.js"></script>` .. `<script src="/script/sceneN.js"></script>` in `workspace/index.html` `<head>`.
3. Define `SCENES` and `window.__filmMeta = { title, width: 1080, height: 1920, fps: 30, duration, durationInFrames, scenes: SCENES }`.
4. Define `window.renderAt = function(t) { ... }` where `t` is time in seconds, dispatching `AM.getSceneRenderer(scene.id, resolved.index)` plus `AM.drawTopHeader`, `AM.drawHeadlinePlaque`, and `AM.drawSubtitles`.
5. Call `window.renderAt(0); window.__ready = true;` once initialized.

# Suggested technical route
HTML: Three.js OrthographicCamera at true isometric angle + soft shadows + AO (three/addons postprocessing), or SVG with SSR matrix faces
(You may choose a better route if it clearly raises quality; say why.)

# Creative seed
Miniature Smart City: An isometric miniature city / data campus that builds itself — the School-of-Motion isometric mograph showpiece.
- True isometric camera (orthographic, 35.264° elevation, 45° azimuth), no perspective, pastel studio palette (lavender ground, mint, peach, sky blue, white) with soft shadows + ambient occlusion so it reads like a premium Dribbble/Behance hero.
- 0–2s: ground tiles flip/drop in as a wave from the centre (tiny bounce each);
- 2–5s: buildings GROW — base lands, walls scaleY from 0 with overshoot, roof caps 2–3 frames later; trees pop; windows light up in sequence;
- 5–8s: life — cars loop along roads, a little train, drones carrying packets, glowing data streams pulse between buildings, a wind turbine spins; camera does parallel slides (no rotation) with 1 : 0.8 : 0.6 parallax layers (foreground clouds);
- 8–10s: pull back to reveal the whole island floating in a pastel void; title card set ON the isometric plane (text skewed into iso space) e.g. "SMART CITY OS".
Sound: bright plucky tech melody (FM marimba/pluck), soft clicks/pops for every tile/building landing, airy whoosh on the pull-back.

You are the director: you may change the concept, copy, story beats and brand names if you find a stronger idea, but the result must remain the CANONICAL, instantly-recognisable form of this style and must hit its signature features below.

# Signature features and key techniques (the result is judged against these)
Clean, technical 2.5D axonometric projection where parallel lines never converge. Perfect for explaining complex systems, cloud architecture, logistics networks, and hardware structures.

**Visual Features**: Strict 30° axonometric angles, modular cubic blocks, three-tone directional lighting (top/left/right), crisp vector edges, grid coordinates, technical callouts.

**Key Techniques**:
- True isometric projection: `rotateX(60deg) rotateZ(45deg)` or 2:1 pixel slope calculation.
- Three-shade shading: Top face = light (+15%), Left face = medium (base), Right face = shadow (-20%).
- Assembly choreography: Blocks fall in sequence from above, snapping precisely into place on the grid.
- Transitions: Elevators lifting layers, isometric rotation sweeps, and grid slice reveals.

# How to work
1. Treatment. Write down one clear idea: a hook in the first 0.5 s (never open on more than 0.3 s of empty or black), an
   escalation, one unmistakable hero moment at ~60–75 % of the runtime, and a composed end frame held ~0.8–1.2 s with living
   micro-motion. Map every signature feature above to a moment. Keep one cue sheet (beats and hit times) that both the
   picture and the sound read from.
2. Key frames before motion. Build the look, render stills at 6–10 key times and actually look at them. Each still should be
   poster-worthy: composition, hierarchy, negative space, type set properly (kerning, line-height, weight contrast, ~5 % safe margins). Iterate until nothing looks default, generic, cramped or "AI-template".
3. Motion. Build the choreography and preview at low resolution. Step through the fastest moves frame by frame: spacing,
   easing, arcs, overlap, anticipation and follow-through, motion blur. No unintended dead spans; the energy follows the music.
4. Sound. Write genre-correct music and sound design locked to the cue sheet. Check that visual hits land on audio onsets.
   Master to the output spec.
5. Final. Render at full resolution (motion blur where apt), then check: exactly 10.00 s, resolution, fps, audio present and at
   the right loudness, no black frames, no fallback fonts or tofu, no clipped elements at the frame edges, no shimmer on thin
   lines, no gradient banding. Fix and repeat until you would submit it to a festival.
6. Write an honest self-critique: what is strongest, what is weakest, what you would do with more time.

# Rules
- Rendering must be deterministic: every frame is a pure function of time t. Seeded randomness only; physics and particles
  precomputed or closed-form; no real-time clocks; no state-triggered CSS transitions. A reliable route: a web page that can
  draw any time t on request, captured frame by frame with a headless browser and encoded with ffmpeg (or a Blender script
  that renders a PNG sequence).
- Assets: only CC0 / public domain / OFL / Apache / free-for-commercial-use. Record each source and licence in CREDITS.md.
  No real brand trademarks; invent brand names.
- On-screen text must be correct, punchy, and natural: proper typography, zero overflow, no typos.

# Craft checklist (what a jury looks for)
- Style authenticity: an expert names the style in one second; every signature technique is present and executed correctly.
- Motion craft: purposeful easing (no linear unless mechanical by design), overlap and stagger, anticipation and
  follow-through, arcs, squash and stretch where the style allows, consistent physics, motion blur where apt; transitions
  carried by elements, not crossfades.
- Rhythm: hits locked to the music; contrast between busy and calm; no monotony.
- Design: strong composition, grid, typographic hierarchy, controlled palette; texture and finishing (grain, glow, vignette)
  only where the style wants it; nothing looks accidental.
- Technical polish: no jitter (unless intended), no popping, no aliasing, no banding, no fallback fonts, no half-loaded images.
- Sound: genre-correct, musical, synced, mastered.

# Before you deliver, score yourself honestly
1–10 on style fidelity, concept wow, motion craft, design & typography, finish & texture, sound & sync, technical
(6 = template-level, 8 = high-end agency, 9 = award shortlist). Aim for 9; fix whatever scores lowest first.

# Deliver
video.mp4, plus a short report: the concept in two sentences; a beat sheet with timecodes; how each signature feature is
realised; the tech route; check numbers (duration, resolution, fps, loudness, true peak); your honest top-3 weaknesses.
