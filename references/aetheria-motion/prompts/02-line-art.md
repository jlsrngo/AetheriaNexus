# Monoline / Technical Line Art & Blueprint (Motion Graphics Standard)
*Ported from award-winning aetheria-motion motion system.*

# Technical Monoline & Blueprint Motion Design

**Reference Benchmark**: ATELIER LINEAOne Line Continuous Flow · 1920×1080 · 30 fps · 10 s · AI Jury Score 7.64 / 10

**Reference Source**: [cues.json](../../../references/aetheria-motion/demos/02-line-art/cues.json) · [index.html](../../../references/aetheria-motion/demos/02-line-art/index.html)

## How to Use

1. Open Aetheria Video Studio and invoke this skill using the command or natural language.
2. The skill injects the creative seed, timing choreography, palette tokens, and motion curves into the LLM context.
3. **Customization**: Adapt the narrative, brand names, copy, and palette in `Creative seed` while preserving `Signature features` to retain the iconic visual identity of this archetype.
4. **Verification**: Review the resulting Aetheria HTML film (workspace/index.html) in the interactive Studio player against the motion design craft checklist below to guarantee award-winning quality.

## System Prompt Template

# Vertical 9:16 Spatial Layout Contract (1080×1920 Mobile Standard)
When generating vertical 9:16 content, LLM MUST strictly adhere to this vertical spatial zoning to avoid empty voids, clashing elements, or UI clipping:

| Zone ID | Vertical Span (Y) | Component Type | Constraints & Styling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zone 0** | `Y: 60 – 240px` | Top Header Bar & Stamp/Badge | Monospace topic bar across top (`Y: 70`). Stamps/tags MUST be anchored to top-left (`left: 64`) or top-right (`right: 64`) with 8–14° tilt. **NEVER slap large text in center X:50% that occludes the hero below!** |
| **Zone 1** | `Y: 260 – 920px` | Backdrop Graphic Bed / Sheet | Angled style-specific backdrop, grid card, or paper scrap (`width: 720–820px`, tilted -8° to +8°). Serves as visual backing so the hero never floats in an empty void. |
| **Zone 2** | `Y: 340 – 1050px` | Hero Subject / Core Visual Anchor | Primary focal point. `width: 520–620px`, `height: 600–720px`, centered. Wajib style-specific rim/border/glow and subtle micro-motion/jitter. |
| **Zone 3** | `Y: 880 – 1100px` | Style Accents & Connectors | Style-specific accent props (pointing hands, stickers, sparks, geometric chips) bridging transition between hero and headline. |
| **Zone 4** | `Y: 1100 – 1380px` | Bold Style Action Headline | High-contrast headline card/plaque with `box-shadow: 8px 8px 0 #1A1A1A`, uppercase bold typography (`fontSize: 64–76px`), and sub-badge (`fontSize: 20–24px`). |
| **Zone 5** | `Y: 1500 – 1720px` | Kinetic Subtitles (Hormozi) | Clean word chips anchored at `bottom: 200–240px`. Maximum font size 58–64px with lemon-yellow `#FFDE59` active pop. |
| **Deadzone**| `Y > 1750px` & `X > 960px` | TikTok UI Exclusion Zone | NEVER place critical text or heroes in the bottom 180px or extreme right rail (avatar, like, comment, share, sound disc). |

# Aetheria Modular HTML Motion Engine Contract (Mandatory)
Never cram a multi-scene video into a single 1,000-line HTML file. Split scenes into modular scripts (no React, no TypeScript):
1. Write each scene in `workspace/script/scene1.js` .. `workspace/script/sceneN.js` (~120–180 lines each) using `AM.registerScene("scene1_id", function(ctx, localTime, dur, scene, AM) { ... })`.
2. Include `<script src="/script/aetheria-motion.js"></script>` and `<script src="/script/scene1.js"></script>` .. `<script src="/script/sceneN.js"></script>` in `workspace/index.html` `<head>`.
3. Define `SCENES` and `window.__filmMeta = { title, width: 1080, height: 1920, fps: 30, duration, durationInFrames, scenes: SCENES }`.
4. Define `window.renderAt = function(t) { ... }` where `t` is time in seconds, dispatching `AM.getSceneRenderer(scene.id, resolved.index)` plus `AM.drawTopHeader`, `AM.drawHeadlinePlaque`, and `AM.drawSubtitles`.
5. Call `window.renderAt(0); window.__ready = true;` once initialized.

# Suggested technical route
HTML: SVG paths + stroke-dashoffset (getTotalLength) + GSAP; a virtual camera that follows the pen tip
(You may choose a better route if it clearly raises quality; say why.)

# Creative seed
One-line narrative: One-line narrative for a luxury / architecture brand — the whole film is ONE continuous line.
- Deep midnight ground (#0B1320 or near-black) + a single champagne-gold line (#E9D7A5), constant ~3px, round caps, a softly glowing pen tip that leads the draw.
- Story (continuous path, the tail of each figure is the start of the next): a seed → sprouts into a sapling → branches become the structural lines of a building → the building outline extends into a skyline/horizon → the horizon line lifts and loops into a monogram logo → LINE-TO-FILL moment (logo fills with gold from its anchor) → thin letter-spaced serif wordmark (e.g. "ATELIER LINEA") fades up.
- Draw speed eases into corners (cubic-bezier(0.65,0,0.35,1)); the virtual camera drifts/pushes to keep the tip in frame, then dollies out at the end to reveal the whole drawing composed as a poster; older line segments dim to ~35% as the camera moves on.
Sound: minimal felt piano + soft string swell; a pen-on-paper whisper whose loudness follows tip speed; delicate chime on the fill.

You are the director: you may change the concept, copy, story beats and brand names if you find a stronger idea, but the result must remain the CANONICAL, instantly-recognisable form of this style and must hit its signature features below.

# Signature features and key techniques (the result is judged against these)
Elegant, minimalist technical illustration using uniform stroke weights. Clean engineering blueprints, product cross-sections, and circuit traces that self-draw with mathematical elegance.

**Visual Features**: Single uniform stroke weight (1.5–3px), dark blueprint navy or crisp paper ground, coordinate grids, measurement callouts, dashed reference lines, zero heavy fills.

**Key Techniques**:
- Path tracing: `strokeDasharray` and `strokeDashoffset` animating smoothly from 0% to 100%.
- Self-assembling schematics: Primary outline draws first, followed by internal cross-sections and measurement arrows.
- Precision easing: Smooth cubic bezier deceleration (`easeOutCubic`) mimicking precision drafting pens.
- Transitions: Retracting line loops, blueprint fold-outs, and technical cursor sweeps.

# How to work
1. Treatment. Write down one clear idea: a hook in the first 0.5 s (never open on more than 0.3 s of empty or black), an
   escalation, one unmistakable hero moment at ~60–75 % of the runtime, and a composed end frame held ~0.8–1.2 s with living
   micro-motion. Map every signature feature above to a moment. Keep one cue sheet (beats and hit times) that both the
   picture and the sound read from.
2. Key frames before motion. Build the look, render stills at 6–10 key times and actually look at them. Each still should be
   poster-worthy: composition, hierarchy, negative space, type set properly (kerning, line-height, weight contrast, ~5 % safe margins). Iterate until nothing looks default, generic, cramped or "AI-template".
3. Motion. Build the choreography and preview at low resolution. Step through the fastest moves frame by frame: spacing,
   easing, arcs, overlap, anticipation and follow-through, motion blur. No unintended dead spans; the energy follows the music.
4. Sound. Write genre-correct music and sound design locked to the cue sheet. Check that visual hits land on audio onsets.
   Master to the output spec.
5. Final. Render at full resolution (motion blur where apt), then check: exactly 10.00 s, resolution, fps, audio present and at
   the right loudness, no black frames, no fallback fonts or tofu, no clipped elements at the frame edges, no shimmer on thin
   lines, no gradient banding. Fix and repeat until you would submit it to a festival.
6. Write an honest self-critique: what is strongest, what is weakest, what you would do with more time.

# Rules
- Rendering must be deterministic: every frame is a pure function of time t. Seeded randomness only; physics and particles
  precomputed or closed-form; no real-time clocks; no state-triggered CSS transitions. A reliable route: a web page that can
  draw any time t on request, captured frame by frame with a headless browser and encoded with ffmpeg (or a Blender script
  that renders a PNG sequence).
- Assets: only CC0 / public domain / OFL / Apache / free-for-commercial-use. Record each source and licence in CREDITS.md.
  No real brand trademarks; invent brand names.
- On-screen text must be correct, punchy, and natural: proper typography, zero overflow, no typos.

# Craft checklist (what a jury looks for)
- Style authenticity: an expert names the style in one second; every signature technique is present and executed correctly.
- Motion craft: purposeful easing (no linear unless mechanical by design), overlap and stagger, anticipation and
  follow-through, arcs, squash and stretch where the style allows, consistent physics, motion blur where apt; transitions
  carried by elements, not crossfades.
- Rhythm: hits locked to the music; contrast between busy and calm; no monotony.
- Design: strong composition, grid, typographic hierarchy, controlled palette; texture and finishing (grain, glow, vignette)
  only where the style wants it; nothing looks accidental.
- Technical polish: no jitter (unless intended), no popping, no aliasing, no banding, no fallback fonts, no half-loaded images.
- Sound: genre-correct, musical, synced, mastered.

# Before you deliver, score yourself honestly
1–10 on style fidelity, concept wow, motion craft, design & typography, finish & texture, sound & sync, technical
(6 = template-level, 8 = high-end agency, 9 = award shortlist). Aim for 9; fix whatever scores lowest first.

# Deliver
video.mp4, plus a short report: the concept in two sentences; a beat sheet with timecodes; how each signature feature is
realised; the tech route; check numbers (duration, resolution, fps, loudness, true peak); your honest top-3 weaknesses.
